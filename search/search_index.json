To which input does the learner has access to? a) Testing Data b) Label Data c) Training Data d) Cross-Validation Data</p> <p>Explanation: The learner gets access to a particular set of data on which it trains.

The label data is a representation of different types of the dependent variables.</p> <p>18.  The set which represents the different instances of the target variable is known as ______ a) domain set b) training set c) label set d) test set</p> <p>Explanation: Label Set denotes all the possible forms the target variable can take (for e.g. {0,1} or {yes, no} in a logistic regression problem). Domain Set represents the vector of features, given as input to the learner. Training Set and Test Set are parts of the Domain Set which are used for training and testing respectively.</p> <p>19.

It is assumed that the learner has prior knowledge about the probability distribution which generates the instances in a training set. a) True b) False</p> <p>Explanation: The learner has no prior knowledge about the distribution. It is assumed that the distribution is completely arbitrary. It is also assumed that there is a function which \u201ccorrectly\u201d labels the training examples. The learner\u2019s job is to find out this function.</p> <p>21.  The labeling function is known to the learner in the beginning. a) True b) False</p> <p>Explanation: The function is unknown to the learner as this is what the learner is trying to find out. In the beginning, the learner just knows about the training set and the corresponding label set.</p> <p>22. The papaya learning algorithm is based on a dataset that consists of three variables \u2013 color, softness, tastiness of the papaya. Which is more likely to be the target variable? a) Tastiness b) Softness c) Papaya d) Color</p> <p>Explanation: The tastiness is dependent on how ripe the papaya is. The ripeness is determined by the color and softness. Hence color and softness are the independent variables and the tastiness is the dependent variable or target variable.</p> <p>23.  The error of classifier is measured with respect to ___ a) variance of data instances b) labeling function c) probability distribution d) probability distribution and labeling function</p> <p>Explanation: The error is the probability of choosing a random instance from the data set and then misclassifying it using the labeling function.</p> <p>24. What is not accessible to the learner? a) Training Set b) Label Set c) Labeling Function d) Domain Set</p> <p>Explanation: The learner has access to the domain set, from which it extracts the training set. The label set is also given. Then the algorithm is applied to the training set to teach the learner, a function to determine the correct label of a given instance. This is the labeling function.</p> <p>25. What is the possiblility that Subets of a Dataset D are A, B and C as 80%, 10% and 10% sampled resp.

It is usually divided into a training set, a test set and a cross-validation set in the ratio 3:1:1. Since the learner learns about the data set from the training set, the later is usually larger than the test and cross-validation set.</p>"},{"location":"mlquery/questions2/","title":"Machine learning question 2","text":"<p>hi questions</p>"}]}
