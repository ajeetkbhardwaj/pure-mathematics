a) Vector of features
b) Scalar points
c) Polynomials

a) Testing Data
b) Label Data
c) Training Data
d) Cross-Validation Data
> Explanation: The learner gets access to a particular set of data on which it trains. This data is called as training data. Testing Data is used for testing of the learner’s outputs. The best outputs are then used on the cross-validation data. The label data is a representation of different types of the dependent variables.

a) domain set
b) training set
c) label set

**20.  It is assumed that the learner has prior knowledge about the probability distribution which generates the instances in a training set.**
a) True
b) False

> Explanation: The learner has no prior knowledge about the distribution. It is assumed that the distribution is completely arbitrary. It is also assumed that there is a function which “correctly” labels the training examples. The learner’s job is to find out this function.

---
**21.  The labeling function is known to the learner in the beginning.**
a) True
b) False

> Explanation: The function is unknown to the learner as this is what the learner is trying to find out. In the beginning, the learner just knows about the training set and the corresponding label set.

a) Tastiness
b) Softness
c) Papaya
